## About Me

I'm a PhD student at <a href="https://www.vt.edu/"> Virginia Tech</a>'s <a href="https://cpes.vt.edu/"> Center for Power Electronis Systems</a> with the supervision of Prof. <a href="https://cpes.vt.edu/people/faculty/1703"> Qiang Li</a>. I was born and raised in Wenshui, Shanxi Province, China, a small town but with historic stories and profund historical remains. I graduated from <a href="https://english.dlmu.edu.cn/">Dalian Maritime University</a> with bachelor's degree and highest honour, known as Top Ten Students and President's Scholarship, in the summer of 2024. 

My research interest mainly focused on single-stage solution for data center power supply. Nowadays more than 80% costs of data centers' expenditure goes to electricity. Our goal is to expolore and develop high-performance, high-efficiency and high-density power solutions to alleviate the challenges of data centers.
