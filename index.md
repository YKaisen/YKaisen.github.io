My research interest mainly focused on 48V Point-of-Load converter for data center power supply. Nowadays more than 80% costs of data centers' expenditure goes to electricity. Our goal is to expolore and develop high-performance, high-efficiency and high-density power solutions to alleviate the challenges of data centers.
